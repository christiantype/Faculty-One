title: "WU 無"
client: "Faculty"

type: "Poster Series"

about: "Faculty resonates with Zen Buddhism and draws inspiration from its teachings. The meaning of WU 無 is a term that means <i>inner, intuitive experience of Enlightenment</i>—an abstract concept that Faculty aims to grasp. Throughout the the day, there are moments of reflection were truth is ever present and clear. It's here that a certain feeling, emotion, or attitude is grasped and translated into visual medium. Each poster reflects a moment in time where a fragment of enlightenment was felt and captured."
